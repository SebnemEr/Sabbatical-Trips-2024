## Leeds

## London with Greg

### 30 August 2024

- Greg arrives in London on the 30th of August, we meet up at Brunswick
  Square in London. We are staying at a place with a small kitchen
  called [Cleveland
  Residences](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u78fypqrxZ7bhzpx8). We immediately
  set off to explore the London scenes.

### 31 August 2024

- Saturday parkrun - \### 1 September 2024

- In the morning we did a city run:

- [British Museum](https://photos.app.goo.gl/8uuSYqawMpcVGzKo9) Rosetta
  Stone, Cyrus Cylinder, Halikarnassos Mausoleum, and some impressive
  Assyrian stuff. Since we had limited time, catching the train back to
  Leeds, we had to cut it short.

This part is very complicated!

### 19 September, Leeds to Venice:

Me and Greg arrived in Venice. We left Leeds by bus to Manchester and
flew to Venice. Took the Allilaguna line from the airport to the main
island:

alt="At Allilaguna" />

We had chicetti for dinner by the canal at some steps? Venice at night
time is spectacular:

alt="At Allilaguna" />

### 20 September, Venice:

In the morning, me and Greg went for a run, Greg knocked on the door of
the other church since Salute was covered in scaffolding. We hoped to
come back and shower and rest but there was a vaporetto strike so we
decided to go to the Academia, then it was high tide time (12:30 noon)
which meant we had to go to St Mark’s Sq to see the water rising. Then
since we were there, we might as well go the Biennale which is right
there by the gardens.

Quite the tiring day on our feet. 30k steps!

<img src="images/Sept20_1.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Day of 30k steps" />

We went to the train station and met with U&H who were travelling for 24
hrs! Then had prosecco by the steps and off to bed.

### 21 September, Venice:

We set off by taking the Tragettho across the Grand Canal. Walk to St
Mark’s Basilica, quite a queue but moves pretty fast. Once we are in, I
was obsessed with the mosaic floors. We saw St Mary’s family tree and
the [4
horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_of_Saint_Mark#:~:text=The%20Horses%20of%20Saint%20Mark%20(Italian:%20Cavalli%20di%20San%20Marco),)
that were brought from the [Hippodrome of
Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople).

<img src="images/Sept21_1.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="St Mark’s" />

After the Basilica, we had 2 slices of thick pizza each (!), others had
ice-cream and then to the other Biennale venue, Arsenal.

<img src="images/Sept21_2.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Biennale Day 2" />

Went out for meal. No photos of that on my phone.

### 22 September, Venice to Padua:

In the morning Greg goes for a long run, I take the vaporetto, and meet
up with U&H by the coffee shop.

<img src="images/Sept22_1.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Early bird gets the worm" />

After check-out we leave by train to Padua. We arrive in Padua, walk
around the market, and arrive at our Palazo. Beautiful place. We are
starving so we had some bread, cheese, tomato, wine.

<img src="images/Sept22_2.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="To Padua" />

Greg organised us to see Giotto’s famous work at Cappella degli
Scrovegni.

<img src="images/Sept22_3.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Scrovegni Chapel" />

In the evening, we go out for Greg’s birthday dinner. Nice place, nice
wine and nice meal. I don’t actually have many photos from the dinner,
sadly.

<img src="images/Sept22_4.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Greg’s choice for birthday dinner" />

### 23 September, Padua to Ravenna for me and Greg, to Bologna for U&H.

Wake up in Padua. Me and Greg go for a run, then meet with U&H for
coffee downstairs. We met Francesca, the owner, the mother of
Alessandro, and daughter of the owner of the place we stay.

<img src="images/Sept23_1.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="Padua circle" />

Then we set off for a stroll, Greg is cross with me and U for going into
Mango and shopping!!! See Mango pic for the Mango incident. Greg
actually wanted to go to the [Palazzo della
Ragione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_della_Ragione,_Padua#:~:text=The%20Palazzo%20della%20Ragione%20is%20a%20medieval%20market%20hall,%20town#:~:text=The%20Palazzo%20della%20Ragione%20is%20a%20medieval%20market%20hall,%20town).
We have been there before btw. Anyway, he sets off only to find out that
it is closed. Now what do we do! Eat food and icecream since we are
there.

<img src="images/Sept23_2.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Meandering in Padua streets via Mango" />

The owners of the place were kind to let us leave our bags until 1pm or
something. We were packed. So we go and collect our bags and off to
Padua train station to say goodbye to U&H and me and Greg hire a car
from Alemo and drive to Ravenna, the town of mosaics.

alt="Ravenna mosaics" />

<img src="images/mosaicsRavenna_2.jpg" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Ravenna mosaics" />

We are staying at Casa Masoli, very nice place.

<img src="images/casamasoliRavenna.jpg" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Casa Masoli" />

We first visit [𝗖𝗔𝗣𝗣𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗔 𝗔𝗥𝗖𝗜𝗩𝗘𝗦𝗖𝗢𝗩𝗜𝗟𝗘 - 𝗢 𝗗𝗜
𝗦𝗔𝗡𝗧’𝗔𝗡𝗗𝗥𝗘𝗔](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NYama9ZwUsEFTdPX7)

<img src="images/Sept23_3.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Ravenna Arcivescovile - a Byzantine chapel with elaborate mosaics" />

A great video can be seen on
[Youtube](https://youtu.be/ekB1NeKtDX4?si=55l1WBVh2qWxIKZH).

From there we visited the [Basilica of St
Vitale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_San_Vitale). I am
super impressed with this one. It looks gorgeous from outside, and
resembles Ayasofya.

<img src="images/Sept23_4.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Ravenna Basilica of St Vitale" />

<img src="images/Sept23_5.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Ravenna Basilica of St Vitale" />

Look at inside of the basilica in this [Youtube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pytUIajVxGk&t=82s) and of course
my collection of crap photos.

<img src="images/Sept23_6.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Ravenna Basilica of St Vitale" />

Then we stroll around, bump into the Basilica di San Francesco beside
Dante’s tomb, walk in and out, stroll more and end up eating at the
Piazza, crap food place. But food was not too bad…

<img src="images/Sept23_7.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Ravenna streets" />

### 24 September, Ravenna to Florence

The next morning we have a very nice breakfast, then check-out and drop
bags at the car, pay for 2 more hours which turned out to be 4 more
hours. Then we head down to the city center for more. First the [Arian
Baptistery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arian_Baptistery).

<img src="images/Sept24_1.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Ravenna Arian Baptistery" />

Great [Youtube video
again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQBS2ZxOBnQ&t=4s).

Jeez, this Ravenna has soooo much to see and digest! Another place is
the [Basilica di Sant’Apollinare
Nuovo](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_di_Sant%27Apollinare_Nuovo).
So crazy!

<img src="images/Sept24_2.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Ravenna Basilica di Sant’Apollinare Nuovo" />

Then we drive to Florence.

<img src="images/Sept24_3.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="Ravenna to Florence" />

Immediately set off to meet with others. First we see the Gates of
Paradise, the main gate of the Baptistry of Florence (Battistero di San
Giovanni), located in front of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore.
[Porta del
Paradiso](https://www.florenceinferno.com/gates-of-paradise/).

Then we meet up with U, H & Mary and stroll around after buying our
tickets. We stroll through to the river.

<img src="images/Sept24_3.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Florence" />

And we end up having dinner at a very nice place. Some icecream and
music and back to our place with Henry’s bags. Henry comes tomorrow once
U&M leave for Sicily.

<img src="images/Sept24_4.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Florence evening" />

### 25 September, Florence full day

Me and Greg take the tram, quite the rushed one, since we are a few min
late. But we make it to the opening hour of the [Bargello
Museum](https://bargellomusei.it/en/museum/museo-nazionale-del-bargello/).

We see Donatello’s David and other sculptures.

<img src="images/Sept25_1.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Bargello" />

<img src="images/Sept25_2.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Bargello" />

There is so much to see in this place but my favourite is the [Flying
Mercury by
Giambologna](https://www.visit-florence-italy.com/museums/bargello/giambologna-bargello-florence-italy.html).

<img src="images/Sept25_3.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Flying Mercury" />

The Bargello Museum had many floors with interesting artefacts, even
from Turkey.

Then we said goodbye to U&M at the piazza. We couldn’t go to the Dome or
the actual David, since tickets were sold out but we climbed up the
stairs of the Cathedral.

<img src="images/Sept25_4.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Tower" />

Inside actual cathedral, we saw many tombs and monuments and more
frescos and things.

<img src="images/Sept25_5.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Cathedral" />

We moved onto the Pazzi Chapel ([Capella di
Pazzi](https://www.santacroceopera.it/luoghi/chiostri/cappella-pazzi/)).
Here is a great [Youtube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xemmv07O9yc) about the
architecture.

<img src="images/Sept25_6.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Pazzi Chapel" />

From there we moved to [Uffizi
Gallery](https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi). I have tons of photos.
But most striking one is the actual Medici Venus we saw in UK. These are
extremely good sculptures, good quality marble, extreme talent.

<img src="images/Sept25_7.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Uffizi 1" />

<img src="images/Sept25_8.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Uffizi 2" />

<img src="images/Sept25_9.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Uffizi 3" />

There is so many, but cannot add them all here.

Then we exhausted people walk home with the hope that we will cook and
eat and sleep quickly. Except we couldn’t work the stove top electric
genius device. Ah well, all it needed was a reboot!

<img src="images/Sept25_10.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Exhausted art chasers" />

### 26 September, Florence to Parma

We leave our place after some breakfast. We drive to Parma, quite windy
roads, Henry sadly still gets sick with windy roads, forgot about that!
We arrive 3:30 or 4pm. Park our car in an underground park, get out in
the middle of the university. Had to ask the students how to get out.

Then we walked to the city center and go to Piazza Duomo Parma where the
[Baptistery](https://www.piazzaduomoparma.com/en/the-square/baptistery/)
and the [Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma_Cathedral) is.
The cathedral contains the illusionistic cupola fresco of the Assumption
by Corregio. Everywhere we saw these [Correggio500
special](https://www.piazzaduomoparma.com/en/correggio500-special-parma-8-september-2024-31-january-2025/)
signs/stickers.

<img src="images/Sept26_1.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Parma cathedral" />

After the cathedral, we visit the Baptistery. Here the months and
seasons are interesting.

<img src="images/Sept26_2.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Parma baptistery" />

Then we find a nice place to have dinner. We had to have Lambrusco. Last
dinner of the age 40s for Greg. Greg had the Rose of Parma, Henry had
something with apple sauce, I had the pistachio pasta with four grain
tagliatelle type. We all had desert and all was yummy.

<img src="images/Sept26_3.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Parma last dinner of age 40s" />

### 27 September, Parma to Lago de Como

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO GREG!

In the morning, me and Greg go for a run in Parma, find some parks.

<img src="images/Sept27_1.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Parma happy birthday run" />

Then we come back, shower, pack our car (access to the car is super high
tech and full of barriers), and check out, then have breakfast. Coffee
with croissants.

Then we go to the Proscuiterria and spend a fortune for our sandwiches.

<img src="images/Sept27_2.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Parma Proscuiterria" />

Then we eat our sandwiches in the park. Greg goes off to search for his
Christmas time deserty cake. No luck.

We set off to drive to Como. We arrive at 3-4pm I think. We go for a
walk, wow what a magical place! We walk to the Big Bench, the viewing
points etc.

<img src="images/Sept27_3.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Como" />

<img src="images/Sept27_4.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Como stroll" />

Birthday dinner was delicious but not sure of the place.

<img src="images/Sept27_5.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Como birthday dinner" />

### 28 September, Como full day

In the morning, we went to Bellagio city center. Visited the Palace by
the water.

<img src="images/Sept28_1.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Como Bellagio" />

Then we took the ferry to the other busy town. Wow busy is a small word.
Cannot imagine this place in summer when schools are on holiday.

<img src="images/Sept28_2.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Como ferry" />

In the evening me and Greg went to see the Cycling Museum and the
Church. And came home to progress on our giant Lambrusco bottle. Food
cooked at home too. Pasta is super easy!

<img src="images/Sept28_3.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="Como goodbye" />

### 29 September, Como to Millan and from Milan to CT and to Spain for me.

In the morning, me and Greg went to see the sunrise to the viewing
point. Leaving eachother again today. We drive to Milan, leave the car
at the airport and G&H to CT and me to Valencia.

<img src="images/Sept29_1.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Falling apart again" />

And I take the buses to travel to Valencia. I choose a night time bus,
horrible. Sat next to the toilet. Yuck. Well will not use the FlixBus
again.
