Rosetta Stone, Cyrus Cylinder, Halikarnassos Mausoleum, and some impressive Assyrian stuff. Since we had limited time, catching the train back to Leeds, we had to cut it short.

# Italy
This part is very complicated!

### 19 September, Leeds to Venice:

Me and Greg arrived in Venice. We left Leeds by bus to Manchester and flew to Venice. Took the Allilaguna line from the airport to the main island:

We had chicetti for dinner by the canal at some steps? Venice at night time is spectacular:

### 20 September,  Venice:

In the morning, me and Greg went for a run, Greg knocked on the door of the other church since Salute was covered in scaffolding. We hoped to come back and shower and rest but there was a vaporetto strike so we decided to go to the Academia, then it was high tide time (12:30 noon) which meant we had to go to St Mark's Sq to see the water rising. Then since we were there, we might as well go the Biennale which is right there by the gardens. Quite the tiring day on our feet. 30k steps!

We went to the train station and met with U&H who were travelling for 24 hrs! Then had prosecco by the steps and off to bed.

### 21 September, Venice:

We set off by taking the Tragettho across the Grand Canal. Walk to St Mark's Basilica, quite a queue but moves pretty fast. Once we are in, I was obsessed with the mosaic floors. We saw St Mary's family tree and the 4 horses that were brought from Byzantine.

After the Basilica, we had 2 slices of thick pizza each, icecream and then to the other Biennale venue, Arsenal.

Went out for meal.

### 22 September, Venice to Padua:

In the morning Greg goes for a long run, I take the vaporetto, and meet up with U&H by the coffee shop.

After check-out we leave by train to Padua. We arrive in Padua, walk around the market, and arrive at our Palazo. Beautiful place. We are starving so we had some bread, cheese, tomato, wine.

In the evening, we go out for Greg's birthday dinner. Nice place.
