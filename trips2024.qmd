# UK
## Leeds
## London with Greg
### 30 August 2024
- Greg arrives in London on the 30th of August, we meet up at Brunswick Square in London. We are staying at a place with a small kitchen called [Cleveland Residences](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u78fypqrxZ7bhzpx8). We immediately set off to explore the London scenes.

### 31 August 2024
- Saturday parkrun - 
### 1 September 2024
- In the morning we did a city run:

- [British Museum](https://photos.app.goo.gl/8uuSYqawMpcVGzKo9)
Rosetta Stone, Cyrus Cylinder, Halikarnassos Mausoleum, and some impressive Assyrian stuff. Since we had limited time, catching the train back to Leeds, we had to cut it short.

# Italy
This part is very complicated!

### 19 September, Leeds to Venice:

Me and Greg arrived in Venice. We left Leeds by bus to Manchester and flew to Venice. Took the Allilaguna line from the airport to the main island:

![At Allilaguna](Sept19_1.png){width=70%}

We had chicetti for dinner by the canal at some steps? Venice at night time is spectacular:

### 20 September,  Venice:

In the morning, me and Greg went for a run, Greg knocked on the door of the other church since Salute was covered in scaffolding. We hoped to come back and shower and rest but there was a vaporetto strike so we decided to go to the Academia, then it was high tide time (12:30 noon) which meant we had to go to St Mark's Sq to see the water rising. Then since we were there, we might as well go the Biennale which is right there by the gardens. 

Quite the tiring day on our feet. 30k steps! 

![Day of 30k steps](Sept20_1.png){width=70%}

We went to the train station and met with U&H who were travelling for 24 hrs! Then had prosecco by the steps and off to bed.

### 21 September, Venice:

We set off by taking the Tragettho across the Grand Canal. Walk to St Mark's Basilica, quite a queue but moves pretty fast. Once we are in, I was obsessed with the mosaic floors. We saw St Mary's family tree and the [4 horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_of_Saint_Mark#:~:text=The%20Horses%20of%20Saint%20Mark%20(Italian:%20Cavalli%20di%20San%20Marco),) that were brought from the [Hippodrome of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople). 

![St Mark's](Sept21_1.png){width=70%}


After the Basilica, we had 2 slices of thick pizza each (!), others had ice-cream and then to the other Biennale venue, Arsenal. 

![Biennale Day 2](Sept21_2.png){width=70%}

Went out for meal. No photos of that on my phone.

### 22 September, Venice to Padua:

In the morning Greg goes for a long run, I take the vaporetto, and meet up with U&H by the coffee shop.

![Early bird gets the worm](Sept22_1.png){width=70%}

After check-out we leave by train to Padua. We arrive in Padua, walk around the market, and arrive at our Palazo. Beautiful place. We are starving so we had some bread, cheese, tomato, wine.

![To Padua](Sept22_2.png){width=70%}

Greg organised us to see Giotto's famous work at Cappella degli Scrovegni.

![Scrovegni Chapel](Sept22_3.png){width=70%}

In the evening, we go out for Greg's birthday dinner. Nice place, nice wine and nice meal. I don't actually have many photos from the dinner, sadly.

![Greg's choice for birthday dinner](Sept22_4.png){width=70%}


### 23 September, Padua to Ravenna for me and Greg, to Bologna for U&H.

Wake up in Padua. Me and Greg go for a run, then meet with U&H for coffee downstairs. We met Francesca, the owner, the mother of Alessandro, and daughter of the owner of the place we stay.

![Padua circle](Sept23_1.png){width=70%}

Then we set off for a stroll, Greg is cross with me and U for going into Mango and shopping!!! See Mango pic for the Mango incident. Greg actually wanted to go to the [Palazzo della Ragione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_della_Ragione,_Padua#:~:text=The%20Palazzo%20della%20Ragione%20is%20a%20medieval%20market%20hall,%20town#:~:text=The%20Palazzo%20della%20Ragione%20is%20a%20medieval%20market%20hall,%20town). We have been there before btw. Anyway, he sets off only to find out that it is closed. Now what do we do! Eat food and icecream since we are there.

![Meandering in Padua streets via Mango](Sept23_2.png){width=70%}

The owners of the place were kind to let us leave our bags until 1pm or something. We were packed. So we go and collect our bags and off to Padua train station to say goodbye to U&H and me and Greg hire a car from Alemo and drive to Ravenna, the town of mosaics. 

![Ravenna mosaics](mosaicsRavenna_1.jpg){width=60%}

![Ravenna mosaics](mosaicsRavenna_2.jpg){width=60%}

We are staying at Casa Masoli, very nice place.

![Casa Masoli](casamasoliRavenna.jpg){width=60%}

We first visit [𝗖𝗔𝗣𝗣𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗔 𝗔𝗥𝗖𝗜𝗩𝗘𝗦𝗖𝗢𝗩𝗜𝗟𝗘 - 𝗢 𝗗𝗜 𝗦𝗔𝗡𝗧'𝗔𝗡𝗗𝗥𝗘𝗔](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NYama9ZwUsEFTdPX7)

![Ravenna Arcivescovile - a Byzantine chapel with elaborate mosaics](Sept23_3.png){width=70%}

A great video can be seen on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ekB1NeKtDX4?si=55l1WBVh2qWxIKZH).

From there we visited the [Basilica of St Vitale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_San_Vitale). I am super impressed with this one. It looks gorgeous from outside, and resembles Ayasofya.

![Ravenna Basilica of St Vitale](Sept23_4.png){width=70%}

![Ravenna Basilica of St Vitale](Sept23_5.png){width=70%}

Look at inside of the basilica in this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pytUIajVxGk&t=82s) and of course my collection of crap photos.

![Ravenna Basilica of St Vitale](Sept23_6.png){width=70%}

Then we stroll around, bump into the Basilica di San Francesco beside Dante's tomb, walk in and out, stroll more and end up eating at the Piazza, crap food place. But food was not too bad...

![Ravenna streets](Sept23_7.png){width=70%}


### 24 September, Ravenna to Florence

The next morning we have a very nice breakfast, then check-out and drop bags at the car, pay for 2 more hours which turned out to be 4 more hours. Then we head down to the city center for more. First the [Arian Baptistery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arian_Baptistery).

![Ravenna Arian Baptistery](Sept24_1.png){width=70%}

Great [Youtube video again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQBS2ZxOBnQ&t=4s).

Jeez, this Ravenna has soooo much to see and digest! Another place is the [Basilica di Sant'Apollinare Nuovo](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_di_Sant%27Apollinare_Nuovo). So crazy!

![Ravenna Basilica di Sant'Apollinare Nuovo](Sept24_2.png){width=70%}

Then we drive to Florence. 

![Ravenna to Florence](Sept24_3.png){width=50%}

Immediately set off to meet with others. First we see the  Gates of Paradise, the main gate of the Baptistry of Florence (Battistero di San Giovanni), located in front of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. [Porta del Paradiso](https://www.florenceinferno.com/gates-of-paradise/).

Then we meet up with U, H & Mary and stroll around after buying our tickets. We stroll through to the river.

![Florence](Sept24_3.png){width=60%}

And we end up having dinner at a very nice place. Some icecream and music and back to our place with Henry's bags. Henry comes tomorrow once U&M leave for Sicily.

![Florence evening](Sept24_4.png){width=60%}

### 25 September, Florence full day

Me and Greg take the tram, quite the rushed one, since we are a few min late. But we make it to the opening hour of the [Bargello Museum](https://bargellomusei.it/en/museum/museo-nazionale-del-bargello/).

We see Donatello's David and other sculptures.

![Bargello](Sept25_1.png){width=60%}

![Bargello](Sept25_2.png){width=60%}


There is so much to see in this place but my favourite is the [Flying Mercury by Giambologna](https://www.visit-florence-italy.com/museums/bargello/giambologna-bargello-florence-italy.html).

![Flying Mercury](Sept25_3.png){width=70%}

The Bargello Museum had many floors with interesting artefacts, even from Turkey.

Then we said goodbye to U&M at the piazza. We couldn't go to the Dome or the actual David, since tickets were sold out but we climbed up the stairs of the Cathedral.

![Tower](Sept25_4.png){width=60%}

Inside actual cathedral, we saw many tombs and monuments and more frescos and things.

![Cathedral](Sept25_5.png){width=60%}

We moved onto the Pazzi Chapel ([Capella di Pazzi](https://www.santacroceopera.it/luoghi/chiostri/cappella-pazzi/)). Here is a great [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xemmv07O9yc) about the architecture.

![Pazzi Chapel](Sept25_6.png){width=60%}

From there we moved to [Uffizi Gallery](https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi). I have tons of photos. But most striking one is the actual Medici Venus we saw in UK. These are extremely good sculptures, good quality marble, extreme talent.

![Uffizi 1](Sept25_7.png){width=60%}

![Uffizi 2](Sept25_8.png){width=60%}

![Uffizi 3](Sept25_9.png){width=60%}

There is so many, but cannot add them all here.

Then we exhausted people walk home with the hope that we will cook and eat and sleep quickly. Except we couldn't work the stove top electric genius device. Ah well, all it needed was a reboot!

![Exhausted art chasers](Sept25_10.png){width=60%}

### 26 September, Florence to Parma

We leave our place after some breakfast. We drive to Parma, quite windy roads, Henry sadly still gets sick with windy roads, forgot about that! We arrive 3:30 or 4pm. Park our car in an underground park, get out in the middle of the university. Had to ask the students how to get out.

Then we walked to the city center and go to Piazza Duomo Parma where the [Baptistery](https://www.piazzaduomoparma.com/en/the-square/baptistery/) and the [Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma_Cathedral) is. The cathedral contains the illusionistic cupola fresco of the Assumption by Corregio. Everywhere we saw these [Correggio500 special](https://www.piazzaduomoparma.com/en/correggio500-special-parma-8-september-2024-31-january-2025/) signs/stickers.

![Parma cathedral](Sept26_1.png){width=60%}

After the cathedral, we visit the Baptistery. Here the months and seasons are interesting.

![Parma baptistery](Sept26_2.png){width=60%}

Then we find a nice place to have dinner. We had to have Lambrusco. Last dinner of the age 40s for Greg. Greg had the Rose of Parma, Henry had something with apple sauce, I had the pistachio pasta with four grain tagliatelle type. We all had desert and all was yummy.

![Parma last dinner of age 40s](Sept26_3.png){width=60%}

### 27 September, Parma to Lago de Como

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO GREG!

In the morning, me and Greg go for a run in Parma, find some parks.

![Parma happy birthday run](Sept27_1.png){width=60%}

Then we come back, shower, pack our car (access to the car is super high tech and full of barriers), and check out, then have breakfast. Coffee with croissants.

Then we go to the Proscuiterria and spend a fortune for our sandwiches.

![Parma Proscuiterria](Sept27_2.png){width=60%}

Then we eat our sandwiches in the park. Greg goes off to search for his Christmas time deserty cake. No luck.

We set off to drive to Como. We arrive at 3-4pm I think. We go for a walk, wow what a magical place! We walk to the Big Bench, the viewing points etc.

![Como](Sept27_3.png){width=60%}

![Como stroll](Sept27_4.png){width=60%}

Birthday dinner was delicious but not sure of the place.

![Como birthday dinner](Sept27_5.png){width=60%}

### 28 September, Como full day

In the morning, we went to Bellagio city center. Visited the Palace by the water.

![Como Bellagio](Sept28_1.png){width=60%}

Then we took the ferry to the other busy town. Wow busy is a small word. Cannot imagine this place in summer when schools are on holiday.

![Como ferry](Sept28_2.png){width=60%}

In the evening me and Greg went to see the Cycling Museum and the Church. And came home to progress on our giant Lambrusco bottle. Food cooked at home too. Pasta is super easy!

![Como goodbye](Sept28_3.png){width=60%}

### 29 September, Como to Millan and from Milan to CT and to Spain for me.

In the morning, me and Greg went to see the sunrise to the viewing point. Leaving eachother again today.

![Falling apart again](Sept29_1.png){width=60%}

And I take the buses to travel to Valencia. I choose a night time bus, horrible. Sat next to the toilet. Yuck. Well will not use the FlixBus again.
